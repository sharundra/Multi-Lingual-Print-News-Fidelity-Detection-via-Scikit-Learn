    "\n",
    "Detecting so-called \"fake news\" is no easy task. First, there is defining what fake news is -- given it has now become a political statement. If you can find or agree upon a definition, then you must collect and properly label real and fake news (hopefully on similar topics to best show clear distinctions). Once collected, you must then find useful features to determine fake from real news. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth look at this problem space, I recommend taking a look at Miguel Martinez-Alvarez's post [\"How can Machine Learning and AI Help Solve the Fake News Problem\"](https://miguelmalvarez.com/2017/03/23/how-can-machine-learning-and-ai-help-solving-the-fake-news-problem/).\n",

    "Around the same time I read Miguel's insightful post, I came across an open data science post about [building a successful fake news detector with Bayesian models](https://opendatascience.com/blog/how-to-build-a-fake-news-classification-model/). The author even created a [repository with the dataset of tagged fake and real news examples](https://github.com/GeorgeMcIntire/fake_real_news_dataset). I was curious if I could easily reproduce the results, and if I could then determine what the model had learned. \n",

    "Here, you'll begin with an NLP favorite, `MultinomialNB`. You can use this to compare TF-IDF versus bag-of-words. My intuition was that bag-of-words (aka `CountVectorizer`) would perform better with this model. (For more reading on multinomial distribution and why it works best with integers, check out this [fairly succinct explanation from a UPenn statistics course](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat504/node/40)).\n",
    "\n",
    "I personally find Confusion Matrices easier to compare and read, so I used the scikit-learn documentation to build some easily-readable confusion matrices (thanks open source!). A confusion matrix shows the proper labels on the main diagonal (top left to bottom right). The other cells show the incorrect labels, often referred to as false positives or false negatives. Depending on your problem, one of these might be more significant. For example, for the fake news problem, is it more important that we don't label real news articles as fake news? If so, we might want to eventually weight our accuracy score to better reflect this concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than Confusion Matrices, scikit-learn comes with many ways to visualize and compare your models. One popular way is to [use a ROC Curve](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc_crossval.html). There are many other ways to evaluate your model available in the [scikit-learn metrics module](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics)."
